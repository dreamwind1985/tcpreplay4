tcpprep is a @file{pcap(3)} file pre-processor which creates a cache
file which provides "rules" for @file{tcprewrite(1)} and @file{tcpreplay(1)}
on how to process and send packets.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend all packets from the
input file(s) out a single file.  Tcpprep processes a pcap file and 
applies a set of user-specified rules to create a cache file which 
tells tcpreplay wether or not to send each packet and which interface the
packet should be sent out of.
For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at:

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-dbug "=" \fInumber\fP
Enable debugging output.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 5
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
If configured with \--enable-debug, then you can specify a verbosity 
level for debugging output.  Higher numbers increase verbosity.
.TP
.BR \-a " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-auto "=" \fIstring\fP
Auto-split mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
cidr, port, regex, mac.
.sp
Tcpprep will try to automatically determine the primary function of hosts
based on the traffic captured and classify each host as client or server.
In order to do so, you must provide a hint to tcpprep as to how to search
for clients and servers.  Valid hints are:
.sp 1
\fBbridge\fP
Bridge mode processes each packet to try to determine if the sender is a 
client or server.  Once all the packets are processed, the results are weighed
according to the server/client ratio (\fB--ratio\fP) and systems are assigned an
interface.  If tcpprep is unable to determine what role a system plays, tcpprep
will abort.
.sp 1
\fBrouter\fP
Router mode works just like bridge mode, except that after weighing is done, 
systems which are undetermined are considered a server if they fall inside a 
network known to contain other servers.  Router has a greater chance of
successfully splitting clients and servers but is not 100% foolproof.
.sp 1
\fBclient\fP
Client mode works just like bridge mode, except that unclassified systems are
treated as clients.  Client mode should always complete successfully.
.sp 1
\fBserver\fP
Server mode works just like bridge mode, except that unclassified systems are
treated as servers.  Server mode should always complete successfully.
.sp 1
\fBfirst\fP
First mode works by looking at the first time each IP is seen in the SRC and DST
fields in the IP header.  If the host is first seen in the SRC field, it is a 
client and if it's first seen in the DST field, it is marked as a server.   This 
effectively replicates the processing of the tomahawk test tool.  First
mode should always complete successfully.
.br
.TP
.BR \-c " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-cidr "=" \fIstring\fP
CIDR-split mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
auto, port, regex, mac.
.sp
Specify a comma delimited list of CIDR netblocks to match against
the source IP of each packet.  Packets matching any of the CIDR's
are classified as servers.
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--cidr=192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--cidr=[::ffff:0:0/96],[fe80::/16]
.fi
.TP
.BR \-r " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-regex "=" \fIstring\fP
Regex-split mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
auto, port, cidr, mac.
.sp
Specify a regular expression to match against the source IP of each
packet.  Packets matching the regex are classified as servers.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " -\-port
Port-split mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
auto, regex, cidr, mac.
.sp
Specifies that TCP and UDP traffic over IPv4 and IPv6 should be classified 
as client or server based upon the destination port of the header.
.TP
.BR \-e " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-mac "=" \fIstring\fP
Source MAC split mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
auto, regex, cidr, port.
.sp
Specify a list of MAC addresses to match against the source MAC
of each packet.  Packets matching one of the values are classified
as servers.
.TP
.BR \-\-reverse
Matches to be client instead of server.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Normally the \fB--mac\fP, \fB--regex\fP and \fB--cidr\fP flags specify are used to specify
the servers and non-IP packets are classified as clients.  By using \fB--reverse\fP, these  
features are reversed so that the flags specify clients and non-IP packets are classified as
servers.
.TP
.BR \-C " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-comment "=" \fIstring\fP
Embeded cache file comment.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Specify a comment to be imbedded within the output cache file and later
viewed.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-arg\-comment
Do not embed any cache file comment.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
By default, tcpprep includes the arguments passed on the command line
in the cache file comment (in addition to any user specified \--comment).
If for some reason you do not wish to include this, specify this option.
.TP
.BR \-x " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-include "=" \fIstring\fP
Include only packets matching rule.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
exclude.
.sp
Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only
send/edit packets which match the provided rule.  Rules can be one of:
.sp
.IR "S:<CIDR1>,..."
- Source IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "D:<CIDR1>,..."
- Destination IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "B:<CIDR1>,..."
- Both source and destination IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "E:<CIDR1>,..."
- Either IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "P:<LIST>"
- Must be one of the listed packets where the list
corresponds to the packet number in the capture file.
.nf
    \-x P:1-5,9,15,72-
.fi
would process packets 1 thru 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the
end of the file
.sp
.IR "F:'<bpf>'"
- BPF filter.  See the \fItcpdump(8)\fP man page for syntax.
.br
.TP
.BR \-X " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-exclude "=" \fIstring\fP
Exclude any packet matching this rule.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
include.
.sp
Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only
send/edit packets which do NOT match the provided rule.  Rules can be one of:
.sp
.IR "S:<CIDR1>,..."
- Source IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "D:<CIDR1>,..."
- Destination IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "B:<CIDR1>,..."
- Both source and destination IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "E:<CIDR1>,..."
- Either IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)
.sp
.IR "P:<LIST>"
- Must not be one of the listed packets where the list
corresponds to the packet number in the capture file.
.nf
    \-x P:1-5,9,15,72-
.fi
would skip packets 1 thru 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the
end of the file
.br
.TP
.BR \-o " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-cachefile "=" \fIstring\fP
Output cache file.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
.TP
.BR \-i " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-pcap "=" \fIstring\fP
Input pcap file to process.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
.TP

This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
.TP
.BR \-s " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-services "=" \fIstring\fP
Load services file for server ports.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
port.
.sp
Uses a list of ports used by servers in the same format as of /etc/services:
<service_name>        <port>/<protocol> # comment
Example:
http            80/tcp
.TP
.BR \-N ", " -\-nonip
Send non-IP traffic out server interface.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
By default, non-IP traffic which can not be classified as client
or server is classified as "client".  Specifiying \fB--nonip\fP
will reclassify non-IP traffic as "server".  Note that the meaning
of this flag is reversed if \fB--reverse\fP is used.
.TP
.BR \-R " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-ratio "=" \fIstring\fP
Ratio of client to server packets.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
auto.
The default \fIstring\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 2.0
.sp
Since a given host may have both client and server traffic being sent
to/from it, tcpprep uses a ratio to weigh these packets.  If you would
like to override the default of 2:1 server to client packets required for
a host to be classified as a server, specify it as a floating point value.
.TP
.BR \-m " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-minmask "=" \fInumber\fP
Minimum network mask length in auto mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
auto.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 32
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 30
.sp
By default, auto modes use a minimum network mask length of 30 bits
to build networks containing clients and servers.  This allows you
to override this value.  Larger values will increase performance but
may provide inaccurate results.
.TP
.BR \-M " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-maxmask "=" \fInumber\fP
Maximum network mask length in auto mode.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
auto.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 32
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 8
.sp
By default, auto modes use a maximum network mask length of 8 bits
to build networks containing clients and servers.  This allows you
to override this value.  Larger values will decrease performance
and accuracy but will provide greater chance of success.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " -\-verbose

This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
verbose.
.sp
When enabling verbose mode (\fB-v\fP) you may also specify one or
more additional arguments to pass to \fBtcpdump\fP to modify
the way packets are decoded.  By default, \-n and \-l are used.
Be sure to quote the arguments so that they are not interpreted
by tcprewrite.  The following arguments are valid:
    [ \-aAeNqRStuvxX ]
    [ \-E spi@ipaddr algo:secret,... ]
    [ \-s snaplen ]
.TP
.BR \-V ", " -\-version

by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The \fIhomerc\fP file is "\fI$$/\fP", unless that is a directory.
In that case, the file "\fI.tcppreprc\fP"
is searched for within that directory.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
