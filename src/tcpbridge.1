tcpbridge is a tool for selectively briding network traffic across two interfaces
and optionally modifying the packets in betweeen
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The basic operation of tcpbridge is to be a network bridge between two
subnets.  All packets received on one interface are sent via the other.
Optionally, packets can be edited in a variety of ways according to your needs.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS ""
.TP
.BR \-r " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-portmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite TCP/UDP ports.
This option may appear up to -1 times.
.sp
Specify a list of comma delimited port mappingings consisting of
colon delimited port number pairs.  Each colon delimited port pair
consists of the port to match followed by the port number to rewrite.
Examples:
.nf
    \--portmap=80:8000 \--portmap=8080:80    # 80->8000 and 8080->80
    \--portmap=8000,8080,88888:80           # 3 different ports become 80
    \--portmap=8000-8999:80                 # ports 8000 to 8999 become 80
.fi
.TP
.BR \-s " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-seed "=" \fInumber\fP
Randomize src/dst IPv4/v6 addresses w/ given seed.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
Causes the source and destination IPv4/v6 addresses to be pseudo 
randomized but still maintain client/server relationships.
Since the randomization is deterministic based on the seed, 
you can reuse the same seed value to recreate the traffic.
.TP
.BR \-N " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-pnat "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 2 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
srcipmap.
.sp
Takes a comma delimited series of colon delimited CIDR
netblock pairs.  Each netblock pair is evaluated in order against
the IP addresses.  If the IP address in the packet matches the
first netblock, it is rewriten using the second netblock as a
mask against the high order bits.
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=192.168.0.0/16:10.77.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12:10.1.0.0/24
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--pnat=[2001:db8::/32]:[dead::/16],[2001:db8::/32]:[::ffff:0:0/96]
.fi
.TP
.BR \-S " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-srcipmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite source IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pnat.
.sp
Works just like the \--pnat option, but only affects the source IP
addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.BR \-D " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-dstipmap "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite destination IPv4/v6 addresses using pseudo-NAT.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
pnat.
.sp
Works just like the \--pnat option, but only affects the destination IP
addresses in the IPv4/v6 header.
.TP
.BR \-e " \fIstring\fP, " \-\-endpoints "=" \fIstring\fP
Rewrite IP addresses to be between two endpoints.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option must appear in combination with the following options:
cachefile.
.sp
Takes a pair of colon delimited IPv4/v6 addresses which will be used to rewrite
all traffic to appear to be between the two IP addresses.
IPv4 Example:
.nf
    \--endpoints=172.16.0.1:172.16.0.2
.fi
IPv6 Example:
.nf
    \--endpoints=[2001:db8::dead:beef]:[::ffff:0:0:ac:f:0:2]
.fi
.TP
.BR \-b ", " -\-skipbroadcast
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 addresses.
.sp
By default \--seed, \--pnat and \--endpoints will rewrite 
broadcast and multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses.	Setting this flag
will keep broadcast/multicast IPv4/v6 and MAC addresses from being rewritten.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " -\-fixcsum
Force recalculation of IPv4/TCP/UDP header checksums.
.sp
Causes each IPv4/v6 packet to have their checksums recalculated and
fixed.  Automatically enabled for packets modified with \fB--seed\fP, 
\fB--pnat\fP, \fB--endpoints\fP or \fB--fixlen\fP.
.TP
.BR \-m " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-mtu "=" \fInumber\fP

This option may appear up to 1 times.

The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  1 through MAXPACKET
.fi
.in -4
.sp
Override the default 1500 byte MTU size for determining the maximum padding length 
(--fixlen=pad) or when truncating (--mtu-trunc).
.TP
.BR \-\-mtu\-trunc
Truncate packets larger then specified MTU.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
Similar to \--fixlen, this option will truncate data in packets from Layer 3 and above to be 
no larger then the MTU.
.TP
.BR \-E ", " -\-efcs
Remove Ethernet checksums (FCS) from end of frames.
.sp
Note, this option is pretty dangerous!  We do not actually check to see if a FCS
actually exists in the frame, we just blindly delete the last 4 bytes.  Hence,
you should only use this if you know know that your OS provides the FCS when 
reading raw packets.
.TP
.BR \-\-ttl "=\fIstring\fP"
Modify the IPv4/v6 TTL/Hop Limit.
.sp
Allows you to modify the TTL/Hop Limit of all the IPv4/v6 packets.  Specify a number to hard-code

This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 1048575

Pad or truncate packet data to match header length.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp

IPv4 total length
.sp 1

the actual packet length
.sp 1
\fBdel\fP
Delete the packet
.TP
.BR \-\-skipl2broadcast
Skip rewriting broadcast/multicast Layer 2 addresses.
.sp

broadcast and multicast MAC addresses.	Setting this flag
will keep broadcast/multicast MAC addresses from being rewritten.
.TP
.BR \-\-dlt "=\fIstring\fP"
Override output DLT encapsulation.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
.sp
