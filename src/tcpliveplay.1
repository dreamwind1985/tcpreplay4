.SH NAME
tcpliveplay \- Replays network traffic stored in a pcap file on live networks using new TCP connections
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcpliveplay
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.RB [ \-\fIflag\fP " [\fIvalue\fP]]... [" \-\-\fIopt\-name\fP " [[=| ]\fIvalue\fP]]..." <eth0/eth1> <file.pcap> <Destinatin IP [1.2.3.4]> <Destination mac [0a:1b:2c:3d:4e:5f]> <'random' dst port OR specify dport #>
.PP
This program, 'tcpliveplay' replays a captured set of packets using new TCP 
connections with the captured TCP payloads against a remote host in order to 
do comprehensive vulnerability testings.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The basic operation of tcpliveplay is it rewrites the given pcap file 
in a scheduled event format and responds with the apporiate packet if
the remote host meets tcp protocal's SEQ/ACK expectation. Once expectations
are met, then the local packets are sent with the same payload except with 
new tcp SEQ & ACK numbers meeting the response from the remote hose.  
The inputted pcap file are rewritten to start at the first encounter of the 
SYN packet for correct operation making this packet be the first action in 
the event schedule of local host doing the replay.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR \-d " \fInumber\fP, " \-\-dbug "=" \fInumber\fP
Enable debugging output.
This option may appear up to 1 times.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 5
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 0
.sp
If configured with \--enable-debug, then you can specify a verbosity 
level for debugging output.  Higher numbers increase verbosity.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " -\-version
Print version information.
.sp
.TP
.BR \-h ", " -\-less\-help
Display less usage information and exit.
.sp
.TP
.BR \-H , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \- " [\fIrcfile\fP]," " \-\-save-opts" "[=\fIrcfile\fP]"
Save the option state to \fIrcfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
.TP
.BR \- " \fIrcfile\fP," " \-\-load-opts" "=\fIrcfile\fP," " \-\-no-load-opts"
Load options from \fIrcfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier RC/INI files.  \fI\-\-no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The \fIhomerc\fP file is "\fI$$/\fP", unless that is a directory.
In that case, the file "\fI.tcpliveplayrc\fP"
is searched for within that directory.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.TP
.BR 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.TP
.BR 66 " (EX_NOINPUT)"
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
.TP
.BR 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
